College Football (CFB) Vortex of Accuracy (VoA) is a model which pulls in college football stats from collegefootballdata.com, ESPN, and stats.ncaa.org and ranks FBS college football teams based on those stats. This repo also includes a Vortex of Projection (VoP) script which takes VoA ratings and provides a projection of a winner and win probability for the upcoming week's games.
